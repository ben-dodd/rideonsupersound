          The item and container are absolutely perfect in every way. To qualify as Mint, the item must never have been
          played and is possibly still sealed. Mint should be used sparingly as a grade, if at all. Note that an item
          can be sealed and not Mint. If you suspect your record is in Mint condition, do not play it.

          The item is nearly perfect. Near Mint (NM) media has more than likely never been played, and if it has, there
          will be no imperfections during playback. The item should show no obvious signs of wear. The cover or
          container can have very minor defects., but it should have no folds, seam splits, scratches, or other
          noticeable similar defects. The same should be true of any other inserts, such as posters, lyric sleeves, etc.
          Many dealers wonâ€™t give a grade higher than NM, implying (perhaps correctly) that no item is ever truly
          perfect.

        <div>
          Generally worth 50% of the Near Mint value. A Very Good Plus record will show some signs that it was played
          and otherwise handled by a previous owner who took good care of it. Defects should be more of a cosmetic
          nature, not affecting the actual playback as a whole. Record surfaces may show some signs of wear and may have
          slight scuffs or very light scratches that don&apos;t affect one&apos;s listening experiences. Slight warps
          that do not affect the sound are &quot;OK&quot;. The label may have some ring wear or discoloration, but it
          should be barely noticeable. Spindle marks may be present. Picture sleeves and inner sleeves will have some
          slight wear, slightly turned-up corners, or a slight seam split. An LP cover may have slight signs of wear,
          and may be marred by a cut-out hole, indentation, or cut corner. In general, if not for a couple of minor
          things wrong with it, this would be Near Mint.

        <div className="font-bold font-xl pb-2">VERY GOOD (VG)</div>
        <div>
          Generally worth 25% of Near Mint value. Many of the defects found in a VG+ record will be more pronounced in a
          VG disc. Surface noise will be evident upon playing, especially in soft passages and during a song&apos;s
          intro and fade, but will not overpower the music otherwise. Groove wear will start to be noticeable, as with
          light scratches (deep enough to feel with a fingernail) that will affect the sound. Labels may be marred by
          writing, or have tape or stickers (or their residue) attached. The same will be true of picture sleeves or LP
          covers. However, it will not have all of these problems at the same time. Goldmine price guides with more than
          one price will list Very Good as the lowest price.

          Generally worth 10-15% of the Near Mint value. A record in Good or Good Plus condition can be played through
          without skipping. But it will have significant surface noise, scratches, and visible groove wear. A cover or
          sleeve will have seam splits, especially at the bottom or on the spine. Tape, writing, ring wear, or other
          defects will be present. While the record will be playable without skipping, noticeable surface noise and
          &quot;ticks&quot; will almost certainly accompany the playback.

          Generally worth 0-5% of the Near Mint price. The record is cracked, badly warped, and won&apos;t play through
          without skipping or repeating. The picture sleeve is water damaged, split on all three seams and heavily
          marred by wear and writing. The LP cover barely keeps the LP inside it. Inner sleeves are fully split,
          crinkled, and written upon.
